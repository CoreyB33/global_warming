# global_warming
Repository for assessing global warming statistics using publicly available data

To start this project off, I have created a script that takes a publicaly available global emissions dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/catamount11/who-is-resposible-for-global-warming) and uses it to plot global emissions over the past couple of decades from countries of interest.
